### This is NOT a plugin

This repository provides exercise data and reference materials. It is not an installable Cowork plugin. Students build their own SKILL.md extensions locally during Lessons 9-10 using the Method A interview framework from Chapter 16.

## Customizing for Your Jurisdiction

All materials ship with **Pakistan defaults** (FBR, SECP, ITO 2001, PKR). The reference skills demonstrate the structure — you replace the values for your jurisdiction:

| Variable             | Pakistan Default               | Your Value             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Currency             | PKR                            | _your currency_        |
| Tax authority        | FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) | _your tax authority_   |
| Corporate regulator  | SECP                           | _your regulator_       |
| Tax code             | Income Tax Ordinance 2001      | _your tax code_        |
| Accounting standards | IFRS (as adopted in Pakistan)  | _your standards_       |
| Audit standards      | ISA (ICAP adoption)            | _your audit standards_ |
| Fiscal year          | July 1 - June 30               | _your fiscal year_     |
